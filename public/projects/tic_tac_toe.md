# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe (aka "Noughts and Crosses") is a simple game played between two players on a 3x3 grid.

In this project you will implement the game rules and a text-based UI.

If you're ambitious you could rewrite it later using HTML5 and JS events, but start with the console version, then later integrate the core game code with an HTML app.

## Stories

<!--box-->

### No Rules

**Given** an empty board, and 

**Given** the current player is X

**When** the user selects a cell

**Then** the board redraws

**And** an X appears in that cell

**And** the turn ends
 
**And** the current player changes from X to O

<hr>

**Given** the player is O

**When** the user selects a cell

**Then** an O appears in that cell

**And** the turn ends, and the current player changes from O to X

<!--/box-->

<!--box-->

### Rules

**When** the user selects a cell that is not empty

**Then** the game says "Impossible! That cell is already full." and does not put an X or O in the cell

**And** the current player does not change
 
<!--/box-->
<!--box-->

### Win Condition

**Given** the turn has just ended

**When** if there are three Xs in a row, column, or diagonal

**Then** the system draws a line through the winning three cells

**And** the app says "Congratulations! Player X wins!"

**And** the game ends
 
(and the same for Player O)

### Names

- when starting a game, choose the names of the players (not just X and O)

<!--/box-->
<!--box-->

### Artificial Stupidity

- choose "Player vs Player" or "Player vs AI" to start new game
- simple AI that picks a random empty cell
- human is always X and computer is always O

<!--/box-->
<!--box-->

### New Game UI (HTML VERSION ONLY)

- design a clean "New Game" UI allowing choice of human or computer, name, and symbol
- consider a modal dialog box
- consider button placement and visibility

<!--/box-->
<!--box-->

### Artificial Intelligence

- instead of picking a random cell, the AI chooses the *best* random cell
- this will require R&D
