    lesson name: "scope",
      description: "When can you access a JavaScript variable? It depends on its scope. Let's discuss the various scopes a variable can occupy, including global vs local, functional vs lexical, private vs public. We'll also consider hoisting, this, bind/call/apply, fat and skinny arrows, and more." do

    lesson name: "json",
      description: "JSON is a coding language, but it's not a programming language. Its purpose is to represent data with no behavior attached. It's useful for saving state, transferring information across a network, writing config files or editing settings. And since it's a strict subset of the JavaScript language syntax, it's natural to use it in JavaScript programs and JavaScript-aware text editors."

    lesson name: "rest_and_spread",
      description: "Rest and Spread are modern JavaScript language features that let you transform argument lists, arrays, and key-value pairs into each other concisely. Perhaps too concisely! They can be difficult to understand since a single operator -- dot-dot-dot or '...' -- does a lot of heavy lifting. In this lesson we unpack the dots and examine when to use them... and when not to." do
